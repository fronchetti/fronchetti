# Hi!

My name is Felipe Fronchetti, I am a Master in Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo, and currently a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at Virginina Commonwealth University. In my account you will find tools and replication packages for the papers I've published over the past few years.
Each of my repositories is \*_usually_\* named with the initials of a conference and a year of publication, so that it's easy for other researchers to explore my work.

Althought I like to keep all my research activities on my profile, I'm also working on projects that are hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/vcuse">VCU Software Engineering</a> organization. Feel free to check them out!

# Research
As a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science, my research interests lie in the Software Engineering field, where I investigate alternatives to improve the way humans write code for industrial robots. Among the technologies that I am using on my studies are robots like <a href="https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/collaborative-robots/crb-15000">GoFa</a> and <a href="https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/collaborative-robots/irb-14000-yumi">YuMi</a>, and other high-end devices such as the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens">Microsoft Hololens</a>. 

A great example of a project that I have been working on this year is <a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/news-events/news/03292021-robot-coding-for-everyone.html">Duplo<a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/MDmuNLtOmC4">New video<a>), a block-based programming language for two-armed robots that is designed for users without experience in programming. If you felt interested, you can learn more about some of my projects <a href="https://se.lab.vcu.edu/research/robotics/">here</a>.

# Background
Although I love to work with robots and mixed reality, my career as a researcher started with open source communities. For more than six years, I investigated topics such as the integration of newcomers in open source projects, the differences between employees and volunteers in open source communities and the benefits of social coding platforms like GitHub. Most of these papers are publicly available on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-6jIjG8AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> profile.
   
**Note:** I am always open to share my knowledge and experience with other students, so please feel free to send me a message on  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fronchat/">LinkedIn</a> if you want to start a conversation!
