# Welcome

My name is Felipe Fronchetti, I am a Ph.D. student in CS at VCU, and this is my GitHub profile!
In my account you will find tools and replication packages for the research papers I published. 
Each repository is named with the initials of the conference and the year of publication (for example, <a href="https://github.com/fronchetti/OSS-2019">OSS-2019</a>). 

Althought I like to keep my research activities in my own profile, I'm also working on projects hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/vcuse">VCU Software Engineering</a> organization. Feel free to check them out!

# Research
As a software engineering researcher, I investigate the intersection between collaborative robots and mixed reality, looking for better alternatives to how humans program robot controllers.

Among the technologies I'm currently using are ABB robots such as the IRB 14.000 and CRB 15.000, and the Microsoft mixed reality headset, Hololens 2.
