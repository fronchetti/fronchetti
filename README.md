# Hello!

My name is Felipe Fronchetti, and this is my GitHub profile! In my account you will find tools and replication packages for the papers I've published over the past few years.
Each repository is usually named with the initials of a conference and a year of publication, such that it is easy for other researchers to browse my work.

Althought I like to keep my research activities on my own profile, I'm always working on projects that are hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/vcuse">VCU Software Engineering</a> organization. Feel free to check them out!

# Research
I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at Virginia Commonweatlh University. As a researcher, I study the software engineering field, where I currently investigate alternatives to improve the way humans program robot controllers. Among the technologies that I usually use on my studies are collaborative robots like the <a href="https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/collaborative-robots/crb-15000">CRB 15000</a>, and mixed reality headsets, such as the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens">Microsoft Hololens 2</a>. 

A great example of a project that I have been working on this year is <a href="https://github.com/vcuse/duplo">Duplo<a>, a block-based programming language for two-armed robots that is designed for users without experience in programming (Read more about it <a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/news-events/news/03292021-robot-coding-for-everyone.html#">here</a>).

# Open Source
Although I love to work with robots and mixed reality, my career as a researcher started with open source communities. For more than six years, I investigated topics such as the entrance of newcomers in open source projects, the differences between employees and volunteers in open source communities and the benefits of social coding platforms like GitHub. Most of these papers are publicly available on the repositories of this profile.
