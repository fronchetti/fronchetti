# Hello

My name is Felipe Fronchetti, I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at VCU, and this is my GitHub profile!
In my account you will find tools and replication packages for the research papers I published. 
Each repository is named with the initials of the conference and the year of publication (for example, <a href="https://github.com/fronchetti/OSS-2019">OSS-2019</a>). 

Althought I like to keep my research activities in my own profile, I'm also working on projects hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/vcuse">VCU Software Engineering</a> organization. Feel free to check them out!

# Research
As a researcher in software engineering, I am currently investigating the intersection between collaborative robots and mixed reality technologies, looking for alternatives to improve the way humans program robot controllers.

Among the technologies I'm working with, there are ABB robots such as the IRB 14000 and the CRB 15000, and the mixed reality headset, Microsoft Hololens 2.

# Open Source 
Although I've been loving to work with robots and mixed reality, my career as a researcher started with open source communities. For more than six years, I investigated topics such as the entrance of newcomers in open source projects, the differences between employees and volunteers in open source communities and the benefits of social coding platforms like GitHub. Most of these papers are publicly available on the repositories of this profile.
