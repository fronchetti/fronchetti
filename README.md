# Welcome

My name is Felipe Fronchetti, I am a Ph.D. student in CS at VCU, and this is my GitHub profile!
In my account you will find tools and replication packages for the research papers I published. 
Each repository is named with the initials of the conference and the year of publication. such as
<a href="https://github.com/fronchetti/OSS-2020">OSS-2020</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fronchetti/TSE-2019">TSE-2019</a>.

Althought I like to keep my research activities in my own profile, I'm also working on projects hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/vcuse">VCU Software Engineering</a> organization. Feel free to check them out!
